## Introduction

The Python Quiz Game is a console-based application where users can answer a series of questions and receive a score based on their answers. The game will display questions one at a time, prompt the user for an answer, and provide feedback on whether the answer was correct or not.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working on this project, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).

## Project Structure

The project structure is simple and consists of the following files:

- `quiz.py`: The main Python script where the quiz game logic resides.
- `questions.py`: A module containing a list of questions for the quiz.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-quiz-game.git
cd python-quiz-game
```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

3. Run the quiz game script.

```bash
python quiz.py
```

## Creating Questions

Open the `questions.py` file to add your quiz questions. Each question is represented as a dictionary with the following structure:
"""python code"""
answer = input("what you do when you are alone? ")
if answer == "i read books":
    print('Correct!')
  
else:
    print("Incorrect!")

answer = input("what you do when you are confused? ")
if answer == "i will be silent!":
    print('Correct!')
""""python code"""

Add as many questions as you'd like to create an engaging quiz experience.

## Main Game Loop

The main game loop is implemented in the `quiz.py` file. It iterates through the list of questions, prompts the user for an answer, and provides feedback. The loop continues until all questions have been answered.

## Scoring

The scoring system is simple: one point is awarded for each correct answer. The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a simple quiz game using Python. Feel free to customize and expand upon this project to add more features, such as a timer, difficulty levels, or a graphical user interface.

Enjoy coding and have fun playing your quiz game!
